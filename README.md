# MoneyBox iOS Technical Challenge 

This is an iOS app built using UIKit. The app enables a user to view a list of their Moneybox products and allows them to add a fixed amount of Â£10 to their Moneybox. 

## Solution

I've used MVVM-C as the coding convention for this application. Combine is used for binding. Each view model uses dependency injection and a service where appropriate for easier testability. The interface is built using programmatic auto-layout. I have added a scalable UI/UX solution by using predefined font styles which also support dynamic font sizing, as a part of accessibility. I've also created reusable button components to provide a consistent UI experience throughout the application. Comments have been added where appropriate and documentation can be found by visiting Product in the toolbar and building documentation.
